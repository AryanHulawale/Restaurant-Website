🌟 Just Launched: A Responsive Restaurant Website! 🌟

Exciting news! I’ve just completed a fully responsive restaurant website using only HTML and CSS! 🍽✨

This project showcases the power of CSS in creating dynamic, user-friendly web experiences without JavaScript.
By leveraging the skills I acquired from Colt Steele's comprehensive web development course, I designed a site that looks great on any device.

🎯 Key Highlights:

● Responsive design for seamless viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobiles.
● Clean and modern layout to enhance user engagement.
● Built exclusively with HTML and CSS – no JavaScript!

But the journey doesn't stop here!
Starting tomorrow, I'm diving into JavaScript to add even more interactivity and functionality to this project. Can't wait to see how it transforms!
